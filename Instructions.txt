If you do not have SML NJ already installed, visit http://www.smlnj.org/install/index.html and follow the appropriate instructions.

Open command line. From this directory, run sml.

Run the command:
	use "PhaseX.ml";
and replace the X with 1, 2, or 3, depending on the desired phase.

The program will create initial functions and then appear to pause. At this point, enter a csv filename without the extension.
	Phase 1: {A1,A2,A3,A4,B1,B2,B3,F1,F2,G1,G2,G3,k05,k10,k24,k30}
	Phase 2 and 3: {h05, h09, h10, h14, h24, h25, h50, h100, h150, hSh}
